# Portfolio Manager
## What It Is

Portfolio Manager is a web interface for tracking an investment portfolio. Enter the stock tickers in your portfolio, the allocations you prefer, and it'll both report your profitability as well as advise how to rebalance your assets.

Uses the IEX Cloud API for stock data. May support other sources in the future.

This is still in development and not ready for active use. Check back periodically if interested. Feel free to ask questions or submit issues.
